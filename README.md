  <p>This institution aims to put in place methods for identifying counterfeit euro banknotes.They therefore call on you, a data specialist, to set up a model that would be able to automatically identify the real ones from the fake ones.And this simply from certain dimensions of the banknote and theelements that compose it.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


## About The Project

Fake bills may have serial numbers that are not evenly spaced or that are not perfectly aligned in a row. If you received multiple suspicious bills, see if the serial numbers are the same on both bills. If they are the same, then they are counterfeit notes.


## Idea of projects with this dataset:

* Predicting the missing values with a linear regression or a KNN imputer

* Comparing classification such as logistic regression or KNN with an unsupervised model such as K-Means to predict the authenticity of the bills

* Trying to do a PCA or a Kernel Transform to create a clearer separation between the Genuine and Fake Bills


### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Prerequisites

* Anaconda install
  ```sh
  pip install anaconda
