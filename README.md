  <p>This institution aims to put in place methods for identifying counterfeit euro banknotes.They therefore call on you, a data specialist, to set up a model that would be able to automatically identify the real ones from the fake ones.And this simply from certain dimensions of the banknote and theelements that compose it.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Fake bills may have serial numbers that are not evenly spaced or that are not perfectly aligned in a row. If you received multiple suspicious bills, see if the serial numbers are the same on both bills. If they are the same, then they are counterfeit notes.

Idea of projects with this dataset:

- Predicting the missing values with a linear regression or a KNN imputer

- Comparing classification such as logistic regression or KNN with an unsupervised model such as K-Means to predict the authenticity of the bills

- Trying to do a PCA or a Kernel Transform to create a clearer separation between the Genuine and Fake Bills
-
